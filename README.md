# Files for *Secret extraction attacks against obfuscated IQP circuits*

This repository is based on commit 11d4c5258ae20d732eee1d141418d23d3a0b7a27 of https://github.com/AlaricCheng/stabilizer_protocol_sim

Attacks described in the paper can be accessed via the scripts

- radical-attack.py
- lazy-linearity-attack.py
- double-meyer.py
- hamming-razor.py

Various options can be set at the end of the respective files.


- attacks-data/ contains the data generated by the large-scale numerical experiments on the Radical Attack, and various scripts for processing them

- manuscript-figures/ contains code and data to generate the remaining figures


# README of original repository below

### Overview

This is the repo for [arXiv:xxxx.xxxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx). 

- `lib/` is the directory for source codes of the stabilizer scheme and the Linearity Attack. It also contqains `new_attacks.py' where all attacks documented in the manuscript are implemented
- `scripts.py` is the source code for generating data, stored in `data/`, which will be used for plotting figures in our paper by `proc_data.py`. The figures are stored in `fig/`.
- `challenge/` contains a challenge instance, stored in `challenge_H.txt`. It requires 10000 samples (bit strings), which will be checked with `lib.hypothesis.hypothesis_test` and the hidden secret. 

### Environment

The specific version of necessary python packages used are as follows.

| Library  | Version |
|----------|---------|
| NumPy    | 1.23.4  |
| galois   | 0.1.1   |
